# Python skeleton 1.0.2

This skeleton incorporates changes for the Python skeleton for the Global Coding Challenge. For reference, files and folders added or modified include:

- .travis.yml
- vcc_skeleton.py
- requirements.txt

These changes will need to be copied and pasted into your skeleton repositories in order for submissions to be valid.

To run tests locally, simply run all tests using your favoured IDE. Please note that this won't produce a green or red build - test results will be printed out to your console.

## PLEASE NOTE: Once you have copied and pasted the files, DO NOT edit the vcc_skeleton file or the .travis.yml file.

Good luck!
